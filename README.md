### ✅ Next Step:
If you share your **exact package names** (like `com.student.library` or `com.rahul.librarysystem`) and **entities used** (like `Book`, `Student`, `IssueRecord`),  
I can update this README structure and endpoint table to match your exact project — making it **ready for GitHub upload** with perfect alignment.  
Would you like me to do that?
